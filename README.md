# FINAL PROJECT
### EE108 :: Fall 2015

This is where the documentation will go.  Eventually.  You know, when we finish this thing.

#### Proposed Point Values (PPV)
- Harmonics - 3 ptz
- Dynamics - 3 ptz
- Chords - 4 ptz
- Color Changing Waveform - 2-3 ptz
- Launchpad - 2+ ptz
- Context Sensitive Display (launchpad buttons) - 1 pt

#### Work Distribution
- Alex - Chords, Launchpad, (Context Sensitive), Revamping song ROM format
- Brendan - Dynamics, Color Changing
- Nick - Harmonics, Chords

#### Other Proposed Extensions
- Multiple Voices
- Some idea that Brendan had and no longer wants to do (so scratch this one)
- Speed up/slow down
- Multiple song ROMs
- switch to turn on features (eg echo)
- Color brightness for amplitude of sine wave (we can probably use the same methods here as we're using for decay in dynamics)

#### Miscellania
- Be careful with what you do to the repo.  Ie, "git rm -r ." probably isn't the best idea.
